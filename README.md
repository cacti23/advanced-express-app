Hey there! Welcome to the Advanced Node (2023) repository 🎉

We're excited to explore advanced node concepts for production deployment in this full-blown node blog application! 🚀

This project is equipped with authentication, react-client, and MongoDB. And the best part? All the code is working and updated, as it was completed in 2023 🙌

## Changelog 📝

Before we get started, make sure to setup your keys in a `.env` file in root and run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

Now let's dive into the exciting updates we've made:

### Updates in server 💻

We've upgraded all dependencies to the latest versions and switched to using `yarn` instead of `npm`. We've also added support for `module-alias` to allow aliasing of modules in `require()` and switched to `.env` files for managing keys. Plus, we've made some code cleanups to ensure a smooth and efficient experience.

### Updates in `client` 💻

We've also upgraded all dependencies to the latest versions and switched to using `yarn` instead of `npm`. We've added `jsconfig.json` to support module path alias directly starting from `src`. And just like with the server, we've made some code cleanups to ensure a seamless experience.

We've even added some new branches with updated code for each section so you can explore even further:

- **_implement-redis_** 🚀
- **_implement-headless-browser-testing_** 🕸️
- **_implement/ci-cd_** 🤖
- **_implement-scalable-image-s3-upload_** 📸

Exciting, right? Let's get started by running `yarn dev`, `yarn build`, or `yarn start` to see all these updates in action! 💪

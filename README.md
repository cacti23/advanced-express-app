Hey there! Welcome to the Advanced Node (2023) repository 🎉

We're excited to explore advanced node concepts for production deployment in this full-blown node blog application! 🚀

This project is equipped with authentication, react-client, and MongoDB. And the best part? All the code is working and updated, as it was completed in 2023 🙌
